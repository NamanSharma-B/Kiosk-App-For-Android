Kiosk App for Android – Secure Single-App Mode
The Kiosk App for Android is a secure, purpose-built application designed to lock down Android devices into a single-app or limited-app environment. Ideal for public kiosks, point-of-sale systems, employee devices, and educational tablets, it prevents user access to system settings, notifications, and other apps — ensuring focus and security.

Key Features:

🔒 True Kiosk Mode: Locks the device to a specific app, blocking the home button, recent apps, and status bar access.

🔁 Auto-Launch After Reboot: Automatically relaunches the target app on device boot or after screen lock.

👆 Secure Exit: Exiting Kiosk Mode requires a long-press volume-up gesture (5s) followed by password authentication.

🛡️ Permissions Enforcement: Manages Device Admin, Usage Stats, Overlay, and Accessibility permissions for uninterrupted operation.

🔄 App Monitoring: Continuously monitors the foreground app and brings the target app back if interrupted.

🚫 Uninstall Protection: Prevents uninstallation unless kiosk mode is properly exited.
